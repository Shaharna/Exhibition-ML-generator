De tuin van de inrichting,Garden of the Asylum,Vincent van Gogh,september,1889,France,Saint-Rémy-de-Provence,oil on canvas,72,91,"This painting shows the garden of the clinic in Saint-Rémy where Van Gogh spent a year. He worked there regularly when his illness meant he was not allowed to venture outside. Van Gogh wrote to his friend Bernard about this painting: ‘You’ll understand that this combination of red ochre, of green saddened with grey, of black lines that define the outlines, this gives rise a little to the feeling of anxiety from which some of my companions in misfortune often suffer, and which is called “seeing red”.’
Van Gogh had discovered that he could use colours to express a feeling. He intensified the emotional charge of his works by combining colours to create harmony on the one hand, or contrast on the other.",,https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/nl/collectie/s0196V1962,Garden of the Asylum.jpg,aa,aa
de schopenscheer,The sheep shepherd,Vincent van Gogh,September,1889,France,Saint-Rémy-de-Provence,oil on canvas,43.6,29.5,"Van Gogh painted this woman shearing sheep ‘in a colour scale ranging from lilac to yellow’. He said so in a letter he wrote to his brother Theo from the psychiatric clinic in Saint-Rémy where he was an inmate. Vincent regained his self-confidence by copying works by other painters. He worked from black-and-white prints, copying the images fairly accurately but choosing the colours himself.
He based this painting on a small wood engraving. It was part of Travaux des champs (‘Work in the Fields’), a ten-part series of prints based on paintings by Jean-François Millet (1814-1875). Vincent wrote, ‘not having any models for the moment it will ensure […] that I don’t lose sight of the figure.’",Jean-François Millet,https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/nl/collectie/s0042V1962,The sheep shepherd.jpg,aa,aa
De boerin die vlas kneust,The farmer's wife who bruises flax,Vincent van Gogh,September,1889,France,Saint-Rémy-de-Provence,oil on canvas,40,26,"Van Gogh painted this Peasant Woman Bruising Flax in a carefully balanced range of colours. He didn’t work from a live model, but from a black-and-white print. It was part of a series called Travaux des champs (‘Work in the Fields’), after paintings by Jean-François Millet (1814-1875). He copied all of the prints in the series.
Van Gogh was pleased with the result. He wrote to his brother Theo: ‘You’ll be surprised what effect the Travaux des champs take on in colour, it’s a very intimate series of his.’",Jean-François Millet,https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/nl/collectie/s0043V1962,The farmer's wife who bruises flax.jpg,aa,aa
De maaier,The Reaper,Vincent van Gogh,September,1889,France,Saint-Rémy-de-Provence,oil on canvas,44,33,"A stooped figure with a scythe is ready to harvest wheat. Van Gogh copied this scene from a print. Copying was an exercise for beginning painters, but he was not embarrassed to do it: 'I can assure you that it interests me enormously to make copies, and that not having any models for the moment it will ensure, however, that I don’t lose sight of the figure,' he wrote to Theo.
Van Gogh had received hardly any formal training. He had taught himself to draw and paint mainly through endless practice. He had an especially hard time with figures at work. That was a subject he kept practising until the end of his career.",Jean-François Millet,https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0198V1962,The Reaper.jpg,aa,aa
Tuin van de inrichting Saint-Paul,Garden of the Saint-Paul institution,Vincent van Gogh,October,1889,France,Saint-Rémy-de-Provence,oil on canvas,73.8,,"Van Gogh drew a great deal of inspiration from the large garden surrounding the institution where he was admitted to in 1889. In the fall, he made this painting that he called ""Falling Leaves"". The autumn mood here is evoked by the colors, the lonely walker, and the leaves carried by the wind.
Van Gogh opted for a high position. As a result, the silhouettes of the tree trunks have been cut off by the lower and upper edges of the painting. He knew this compositional form of Japanese prints and the works of artist friends Bernard and Gauguin.",,https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/nl/collectie/s0046V1962,Garden of the Saint-Paul institution.jpg,aa,aa
Korenveld met maaier,Wheat field with mower,Vincent van Gogh,September,1889,France,Saint-Rémy-de-Provence,oil on canvas,73.2,92.7,"Van Gogh painted this walled field from his hospital room. For the first few months that he was there, he was not allowed to leave the grounds.
The reaper labours in the heat of the sun. The wheat, painted with thick gobs of yellow, undulates around him. For Van Gogh, wheat was a symbol of the eternal cycle of nature and the transience of life. He saw the reaper as 'the image of death . . . in this sense that humanity would be the wheat being reaped.'

He added, however, that this death was 'almost smiling. It's all yellow except for a line of violet hills – a pale, blond yellow. I myself find that funny, that I saw it like that through the iron bars of a cell.'",,https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/nl/collectie/s0049V1962,Wheat field with mower.jpg,aa,aa
Pietà,Pietà,Vincent van Gogh,September,1889,France,Saint-Rémy-de-Provence,oil on canvas,73,60.5,"Van Gogh based his Pietà on a lithograph of a painting by Eugène Delacroix. In fact, it is more a variation on the original work than a copy. From Delacroix, Van Gogh took the theme of the Virgin Mary mourning the dead Christ, as well as the composition. He added his own colour and personal signature.
The painting resulted from an accident. Van Gogh wrote, 'that lithograph of Delacroix, the Pietà, with other sheets had fallen into some oil and paint and got spoiled. I was sad about it – then in the meantime I occupied myself painting it, and you'll see it one day.' The lithograph has survived, complete with stain.",Eugène Delacroix,https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0168V1962,Pietà.jpg,aa,aa
Irissen,Irises,Vincent van Gogh,May,1890,,,oil on canvas,92.7,73.9,"Van Gogh painted this still life in the institution in Saint-Rémy. For him, the painting was primarily a color study. He was looking for a powerful color contrast. By placing the purple flowers against a yellow background, the decorative shapes came out extra bright. The irises were originally purple. The flowers have turned blue due to the bleaching of a red pigment. Van Gogh painted the bouquet twice. In the other still life, he precisely sought a contrast of purple and pink versus green.",,https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/nl/collectie/s0050V1962,.jpg,aa,aa
Olijfgaard,Olive Grove,Vincent van Gogh,November,1889,France,Saint-Rémy-de-Provence,oil on canvas,73,92,"The olive groves around Saint-Rémy were a rewarding subject for Van Gogh. He was fascinated by the ever-changing colour of the olive trees and tried to find a good way of painting their irregular growth. His solution was to use swirling brushstrokes, bold outlines around the trunks and stylized blue shadows.
Van Gogh made his paintings of olive groves just after his friends Paul Gauguin and Émile Bernard had painted a number of religious scenes. They created those works from their imaginations. Van Gogh disagreed with that approach. He felt that reality should always be the starting point: 'My ambition is truly limited to a few clods of earth, some sprouting wheat. An olive grove,' he wrote to Bernard.",,https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0045V1962,Olive Grove.jpg,aa,aa
Wild rozen,Wild Roses,Vincent van Gogh,May,1889,France,Saint-Rémy-de-Provence,oil on canvas,24.5,33.5,"This picture of wild roses may look very pleasant and peaceful, but Van Gogh was actually suffering a severe mental crisis at the time. He had entered the psychiatric clinic in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence as a voluntary patient, hoping to find peace there. As soon as he could, he went out into the gardens to paint or draw.
Van Gogh has painted the fragile blossoms naturalistically. But he has treated the green leaves differently. He has turned them into flat areas of plain colour surrounded by heavy blue outlines.",,https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0190V1962,Wild Roses.jpg,aa,aa
Rozen,Roses,Vincent van Gogh,May,1889,,,oil on canvas,33.5,24.5,"The roses in this painting were originally pink, not white. You can still see a hint of pink here and there. The cause of the colour change is the gradual bleaching of a pigment used in the paint.
Sitting on a leaf at the bottom of the picture is an insect, depicted far more precisely that the rest of the picture. It is a rose chafer beetle (cetonia aurata), complete with the distinctive white stripes on its underbelly and barbs on its legs. Van Gogh had sketched the beetle earlier and probably traced over his sketch when making this painting.",,https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0187V1962,Roses.jpg,aa,aa
Cipressen en twee vrouwen,Cypresses and Two Women,Vincent van Gogh,February,1890,France,Saint-Rémy-de-Provence,oil on canvas,43.5,27.2,"The slender cypress is a characteristic feature of the landscape in the southern French region of Provence. Van Gogh stayed there in 1889-1890, in a psychiatric hospital in Saint-Rémy (FR). He thought the cypresses were beautiful and compared their shape and proportions to those of an Egyptian obelisk.
He painted the trees with swirling brushstrokes in various shades of green and black, with an occasional touch of red for contrast. The colour of the trees was challenging – in a letter to his brother, Van Gogh called it 'that difficult shade of bottle green'.",,https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0147V1962,Cypresses and Two Women.jpg,aa,aa
Amandelbloesem,Almond Blossom,Vincent van Gogh,February,1890,France,Saint-Rémy-de-Provence,oil on canvas,73.3,92.4,"Large blossom branches like this against a blue sky were one of Van Gogh’s favourite subjects. Almond trees flower early in the spring making them a symbol of new life. Van Gogh borrowed the subject, the bold outlines and the positioning of the tree in the picture plane from Japanese printmaking.
The painting was a gift for his brother Theo and sister-in-law Jo, who had just had a baby son, Vincent Willem. In the letter announcing the new arrival, Theo wrote: ‘As we told you, we’ll name him after you, and I’m making the wish that he may be as determined and as courageous as you.’ Unsurprisingly, it was this work that remained closest to the hearts of the Van Gogh family. Vincent Willem went on to found the Van Gogh Museum.",,https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0176V1962,Almond Blossom.jpg,aa,aa
